### WebSocket Server Example

Here's a simple Node.js WebSocket server to receive track data:

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {
  console.log('Extension connected');
  
  ws.on('message', function incoming(data) {
    const trackData = JSON.parse(data);
    if (trackData.type === 'amp_now_playing') {
      console.log('Now Playing:', trackData.track.artist, '-', trackData.track.title);
    }
  });
});

console.log('WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080');
```
